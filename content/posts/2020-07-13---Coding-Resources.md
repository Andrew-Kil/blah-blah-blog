## Free coding websites

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a non-profit organization founded by Quincy Larson with the goal of making learning web development accessible to anyone and everyone. The curriculum is divided into different certifications that you can obtain including Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. Each certification takes roughly 300 hours to complete. In addition to the curriculum, freeCodeCamp also provides a forum as well as a bunch of articles. Subscribe to the [freeCodeCamp YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) to stay up to date with helpful tutorials and guides.

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) is one of the most popular websites for people who are new to coding. There are different career paths and subjects that you can choose from. The core concept of Codecademy is based on easily digestible sections and typing your code into the browser for an interactive learning experience.

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a martial-arts themed platform similar to LeetCode and HackerRank that provides coding challenges in a variety of different languages. The best aspect of Codewars is the community. All of the katas (coding challenges) are created and maintained by the community and my favorite part of using Codewars is that after you solve a kata, you can see the top rated solutions from other users so that you can learn different ways to solve the problem. Feel free to check out my [Codewars GitHub repo](https://github.com/Andrew-Kil/codewars) where I upload my solutions to katas that I have completed.

## Coding podcasts

[Syntax](https://syntax.fm/) is my favorite coding podcast and it's hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski. Wes and Scott are professional developers with years of experience and they both create coding tutorials/courses. You can learn about a variety of different topics including soft skills, React Hooks, and how to get better at problem solving.

[React Podcast](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/) is, you guessed it, a podcast about all things React. It's hosted by Michael Chan and each episode features a new guest and a specific topic.

[Learn to Code With Me](https://learntocodewith.me/) is hosted by Laurence Bradford and is catered towards new coders. The podcasts feature guests who talk about everything from coding bootcamps, hackathons, and how they made the career change from a different industry to land a job in tech.

[CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/) is probably the most supportive community that I've come across and it is hosted by Saron Yitbarek. There are a lot of different topics that are covered including how to deal with imposter syndrome, getting started with game development, and tips to get hired.

## Blogs and communities

[Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/) is the personal blog of Dan Abramov who is responsible for creating Redux and Create React App. There are a lot of interesting blog posts that allow you to gain a deeper understanding of topics such as how function components are different from classes. One of my favorite posts is [Goodbye, Clean Code](https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/) because it gives you an insight into Dan's personal experiences and the lessons he learned along the way.

[CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) offers high quality posts with a lot of details and examples. Great for strengthening your understanding of not only CSS but web design and development in general.

## YouTube channels

[Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA) is a free and comprehensive collection of web development guides and tutorials. Brad Traversy does an amazing job of explaining concepts in a way that is easy to understand and follow along. If I had to recommend one YouTube channel for someone to learn coding, this would be it.

[freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ) offers coding tutorials from a variety of different content creators which means that the videos may be a hit or miss because everyone has a different approach to teaching. That being said, I've found that the videos are high quality and easy to understand.

[The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) is similar to the channels above, however, the main difference is that the tutorials are broken down into smaller videos that dive into the details of the topic.

[Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) is the opposite of a boring and dry coding instructor. Ed is passionate about coding and his personality and humor make his videos fun and easy to digest.

[Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) is a channel that I found out about recently and it has quickly become one of my favorites due to the fact that Kyle does an exceptional job at explaining various topics in a way that is easy to understand.
